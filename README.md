# Windows-Virtual-Pad-Client
# Uses socket module to recieve game pad data from a Raspberry Pi 4
# uses virtualPad module to convert those signals to xinput xbox controller events
# current release works, at the time of writing this, 2 USB SAFFUN N64 gamepads were used to demonstrate analog over socket
# More development is coming for GUI, hopefully up to 4 player xbox pads, controller mapping and more.
